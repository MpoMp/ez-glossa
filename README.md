## EZ Glossa (_Easy ΓΛΩΣΣΑ_)
Simple IDE for a Greek education programming language.

This project is inspired from "[Γλωσσομάθεια](https://spinet.gr/glossomatheia/)", a simple IDE for the "ΓΛΩΣΣΑ" 
programming language.

There is no compiler magic here though; the input program is "translated" to a Java program and then compiled and 
executed as that.
